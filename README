INTRODUCTION
------------

CGAtools is aset of tools to manipulate CGA character
set. The main purpose is to modify or create the fontset
of the original IBM CGA card of comparibles.

As of version 0.1, there are two tools available, 
extractCGAfont and createCGAfont.

extractCGAfont takes a binary dump of the CGA character ROM
and writes a text representation of the fontset, drawing
patterns of the bits on the ROM in the text file so you can
easily change them.

createCGAfont, on the other way, takes this text file
containing the representation of the charset, and creates
a binary file, suitable to be burned on a EPROM, so you
can replace the original character ROM, modifying the CGA 
fontset.


COMPILE
-------

Use "make" under unix with gcc installed, or "make dos" under
DOS with TurboC installed and on path.


USE
---

Both tools are self explaining:

	extractCGAfont <input rom> <output txt>

takes a binary dump of the rom and creates the text 
representation of it.

	createCGAfont <input txt> <output rom>

takes the text representation of the charset and creates
the binary file suitable to be burned in an EPROM.

(on DOS programs are called EXTRACT.EXE and CREATE.EXE)
